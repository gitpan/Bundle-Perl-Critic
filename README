NAME
    Bundle::Perl::Critic - A CPAN bundle for Perl::Critic and related
    modules

SYNOPSIS
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Perl::Critic'

DESCRIPTION
    This is a CPAN bundle file for installing Perl::Critic,
    Test::Perl::Critic, <criticism> and several Policy plugin modules, along
    with all their dependencies.

    In addition to the distributions included below, there is
    Perl::Critic::Dynamic. This is not incorporated here because it actually
    compiles code and is therefore potentially dangerous.

    WARNING: This bundle will install Policies that directly conflict with
    each other. If you do not use a .perlcriticrc file, and your severity is
    set high enough, there is no way for your code to not have violations.
